    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>After making revisions to an Italian recipe for antipasto, I came up with this eggplant salad dish. It is not as time intensive as it appears; many of the steps can be performed simultaneously.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 medium red bell peppers, halved and seeded</li>
        <li>4 small baby eggplants, halved lengthwise</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons olive oil, divided, or more as needed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>2 dashes chile sauce</li>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) jar artichoke hearts</li>
        <li>Â½ cup oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, drained</li>
        <li>4 large fresh basil leaves</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly oil a foil-lined baking sheet. Place bell peppers, cut-sides down, on the baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until beginning to char, about 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>While peppers roast, score eggplant flesh deeply in a diamond cross-hatch pattern with the tip of a knife. Press on the edges of the halves to open the cuts and sprinkle salt over the surface and into the cuts. Set aside, cut-sides up, for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Gently squeeze the eggplant over the sink to extract the salty juice and wipe them dry with a paper towel. Brush each half with 1/2 tablespoon olive oil. Arrange each half, cut-side down, on the lined baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Remove bell peppers from the oven and cover with a dish towel. Let stand for 5 minutes. Leave the oven on.</li>
        <li>Roast eggplant in the preheated oven until tender, about 45 minutes. Peel, seed, and slice the peppers while eggplant is roasting.</li>
        <li>Let eggplant cool for at least 20 minutes before handling. Turn flesh-side up. Use a kitchen knife to scrape the flesh from the skin. Divide the flesh along the score lines into cubes. Discard skin.</li>
        <li>Combine eggplant, bell peppers, artichoke hearts, and sun-dried tomatoes in a bowl. Sprinkle with pepper. Pour dressing over vegetables and mix together. Garnish with basil leaves.</li>
    </ol>
