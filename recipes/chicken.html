    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Try this and you'll know why they call it saltimbocca--Italian for 'jump in your mouth.' It's kind of like it jumps right off of your plate.</p>
    <p>Though it's traditionally made with veal, I made it with chicken. Quick, easy, and so delicious!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 (6 ounce) chicken cutlets</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <LI>½ teaspoon black pepper</LI>
        <li>16 large fresh sage leaves</li>
        <li>16 thin slices prosciutto</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>1 cup low-sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>½ stick butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>If cutlets are thick, lay them between 2 sheets of wax paper and pound to 1/2-inch thickness with flat side of a meat mallet or bottom of a small, heavy skillet. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Put 2 large (or 5 small) sage leaves on top of each cutlet, then wrap 2 slices of prosciutto crosswise around each cutlet, holding sage in place.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add 4 cutlets and cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a platter; tent with foil to keep warm. Repeat with remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil and remaining 4 cutlets.</li>
        <li>Add wine to skillet and simmer, scraping up any browned bits, 1 minute. Add broth and simmer until slightly reduced, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat, add butter, and swirl skillet until butter has melted and sauce is creamy. Spoon 2 tablespoons sauce over each cutlet and serve.</li>
    </ol>
